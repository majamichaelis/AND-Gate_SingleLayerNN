# AND-Gate_SingleLayerNN

<h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>
        In this part of the project, I developed a computer program to implement the perceptron learning rule and the delta learning rule. The program was used to train a neuron to simulate the AND gate. The input patterns and their corresponding teacher signals are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data: (0,0,-1); (0,1,-1); (1,0,-1); (1,1,-1)</li>
        <li>Teacher signals: -1, -1, -1, 1</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The program outputs include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Weights of the neuron</li>
        <li>Neuron output for each input pattern</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <p>
        The program from Part 1 was extended to learn single layer neural networks. The enhanced program can design:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A single layer neural network with discrete neurons</li>
        <li>A single layer neural network with continuous neurons</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The program was tested using the following data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inputs: (10,2,-1), (2,-5,-1), (-5,5,-1)</li>
        <li>Teacher signals: (1,-1,-1), (-1,1,-1), and (-1,-1,1)</li>
    </ul>
